# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a headline topic in today's news, capturing the attention of individuals across various fields eager to leverage its capabilities to enhance their work. Historically, computers were introduced to take on repetitive and mundane tasks, leading to significant advancements in processing speed, communication infrastructures, and storage capacities. However, with the advent of sophisticated AI algorithms, we are now faced with a new level of challenges and solutions.

In the past, problem-solving involved identifying the issue and explicitly programming the computer to transform input data into desired outputs. Software specialists had to meticulously define every step of the problem-solving process to achieve the correct outcome. This traditional method required a deep understanding of the problem and the logic needed to solve it.

The emergence of AI, however, has revolutionized this approach. Instead of explicitly programming each step, we now provide the system with vast amounts of data, allowing it to "learn" and adjust itself to achieve the desired results. This learning process enables AI to tackle problems that were previously unsolvable using classical methods. By training models with large datasets, AI systems develop the capability to make predictions, recognize patterns, and generate insights without human intervention in the learning process.

This shift from explicit programming to machine learning opens up possibilities for addressing complex problems across diverse domains. The challenge now lies in selecting the appropriate type of learning—supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning—based on the nature of the problem and the available data. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each learning type is essential for effectively harnessing AI to solve real-world problems. From art and entertainment to industry, manufacturing, and healthcare, AI's transformative impact is evident. These developments highlight the need for individuals and organizations to embrace AI, as leveraging its potential can drive innovation, efficiency, and improvements across various domains. As AI continues to evolve, integrating it into diverse fields becomes increasingly crucial. Therefore, understanding and utilizing AI is essential to remain competitive and progressive.

## Problem Statement

### ml\@karoprod BMBF Project

Title: Machine Learning for the Prediction of Process Parameters and Component Quality in Automotive Body Production (ML\@Karoprod)

The goal of the project from a machine learning perspective is to optimize the process parameters of a product chain to deform a metal plate through a series of operations. Typically, an expert runs FEM simulations, adjusts the parameters, and evaluates the results to achieve the desired shape. This iterative process, which takes about 20 minutes per cycle, continues until the desired accuracy is achieved, with the expert manually applying the necessary changes and running subsequent simulations.

The process begins with deep drawing, a sheet metal forming technique where a metal blank is radially drawn into a forming die by a punch, with the goal of producing a wrinkle-free and crack-free product. Our simulated deep drawing data consists of a number of valid experiments, each characterized by various process parameters such as blank holder force, insertion position, material ID, and punch ID. In collaboration with our partners, we have identified the relevant set of features that are necessary and sufficient to fully determine the effects of a simulation.

The project partner generated approximately 1000 simulation files in mesh format by varying process parameters. After data cleaning, about 880 of these files were usable. The meshes had three different geometries (with three different depths: 30, 50, and 70), and parameters such as force and material varied, resulting in different final mesh outcomes. The ultimate goal in this section was to train a neural network to predict the dependency between changes in input parameters and the generated mesh. With sufficient training, the model would be able to accurately predict the shape of the final mesh even with new inputs that were not seen during training. This allows the specialist to quickly and accurately observe the final simulation results by manipulating parameters, in a much shorter time compared to traditional finite element methods.
