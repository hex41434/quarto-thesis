        "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a headline topic in today's news, capturing the attention of individuals across various fields eager to leverage its capabilities to enhance their work. Historically, computers were introduced to take on repetitive and mundane tasks, leading to significant advancements in processing speed, communication infrastructures, and storage capacities. However, with the advent of sophisticated AI algorithms, we are now faced with a new level of challenges and solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the past, problem-solving involved identifying the issue and explicitly programming the computer to transform input data into desired outputs. Software specialists had to meticulously define every step of the problem-solving process to achieve the correct outcome. This traditional method required a deep understanding of the problem and the logic needed to solve it.\n",
        "\n",
        "The emergence of AI, however, has revolutionized this approach. Instead of explicitly programming each step, we now provide the system with vast amounts of data, allowing it to \"learn\" and adjust itself to achieve the desired results. This learning process enables AI to tackle problems that were previously unsolvable using classical methods. By training models with large datasets, AI systems develop the capability to make predictions, recognize patterns, and generate insights without human intervention in the learning process.\n",
        "\n",
        "This shift from explicit programming to AI opens up possibilities for addressing complex problems across diverse domains. The challenge now lies in selecting the appropriate type of learning—supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning—based on the nature of the problem and the available data. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each learning type is essential for effectively harnessing AI to solve real-world problems. From art and entertainment to industry, manufacturing, and healthcare, AI's transformative impact is evident. These developments highlight the need for individuals and organizations to embrace AI, as leveraging its potential can drive innovation, efficiency, and improvements across various domains. As AI continues to evolve, integrating it into diverse fields becomes increasingly crucial. Therefore, understanding and utilizing AI is essential to remain competitive and progressive.\n",

        "\n",
        "The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a robust computational technique widely used in engineering and physical sciences to solve complex problems related to structures, fluids, and thermal dynamics. The essence of FEM lies in its ability to break down a large, complicated problem into smaller, more manageable parts known as finite elements. By systematically solving these elements, FEM provides an approximate solution that represents the behavior of the entire system.\n",

        "\n",
        "In these equations, $L(u)$ represents a differential operator applied to the field $u$. This operator encapsulates the specific physical laws governing the problem, such as heat conduction, elasticity, fluid flow, etc. The nature of $L(u)$ depends on the type of PDE being solved:\n",
        "\n",
        "For thermal problems: $L$ could represent the Laplace operator $\\nabla^2 u$ , describing how heat diffuses through a material.\n",

        "\n",
        "To solve this PDE using FEM, the domain $Omega$ is discretized into $m$ finite elements with $n$ nodes. This discretization, along with the boundary conditions, leads to a system of linear or non-linear equations. For a linear operator $L$, this system can be represented as:\n",

The most computationally intensive step in FEM is often the solution of this linear system, particularly when dealing with a large number of elements and nodes. Given that the mesh and its structure play a critical role in the success or failure of FEM, we will address this topic in detail in the next section.\n",

        "### Mesh structure and Its Impact on FEM Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "A mesh is a specialized type of graph, consisting of vertices (points in 3D space) and edges (connections between these vertices), which collectively form the faces that define the surface of a 3D object. For any given geometry, it is possible to generate an infinite number of meshes, making them highly versatile for representing 3D shapes. Meshes are particularly effective and popular due to their ability to accurately portray complex geometries. By increasing the mesh resolution, the quality and precision of the 3D representation are enhanced, allowing for more detailed and realistic visualizations. Dense meshes, in particular, excel at accurately representing intricate details such as corners and curves, making them essential for rendering complex 3D objects. However, higher resolution meshes come with significant trade-offs, as they require more computational power and advanced graphics cards to manage the increased data load.\n",

        "\n",
        "Another aspect of the mesh is its topology. Mesh topology refers to the arrangement and connectivity of elements, such as triangles, quadrilaterals, or tetrahedra, within a mesh. It defines how these elements are connected through their vertices and edges, focusing on the structure and relationships between elements rather than their specific geometric positions. Topology is concerned with the mesh's internal structure without considering the actual spatial coordinates of the points.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, geometry deals with the actual spatial placement and shape of the elements in the mesh. Geometry provides the coordinates and dimensions of each element, defining the shape and size of the mesh within the physical domain. While topology describes the connectivity, geometry specifies where the vertices are positioned and how the mesh represents the physical space.\n",

        "The relationship between topology and geometry is crucial in mesh generation. A mesh with the same topology can have different geometries based on the positioning of the vertices. Good topology is essential for accurately representing the geometry of the model, especially in complex regions. Poor topology, such as elements with bad aspect ratios or improper connectivity, can lead to inaccuracies in representing the geometry, negatively affecting the quality and convergence of the finite element analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "A mesh in the context of FEM is defined as a network of interconnected elements that subdivides a complex geometry into smaller, simpler parts, known as elements or cells. These elements can take various shapes, such as triangles or quadrilaterals in 2D, and tetrahedra or hexahedra in 3D. In this context, the vertices of the mesh are referred to as nodes, and the faces are known as elements. The connections between nodes, which form the edges, are typically called edges or connections in FEM. The mesh serves as the framework over which the mathematical equations governing the physical behavior of the system are solved. The quality and resolution of the mesh are crucial, as they directly influence the accuracy, convergence, and computational efficiency of FEM analyses. A finer mesh improves accuracy but requires more computational resources, while a coarser mesh reduces computational demand but lowers precision. Understanding the structure and characteristics of the mesh is essential for optimizing FEM simulations and achieving reliable results in complex engineering problems.\n",

        "\n",
        "In general, suitable meshes for FEM should exhibit several essential characteristics: they must be sufficiently refined to accurately capture the geometry and stress gradients of the structure, with a higher mesh density in regions of high stress or complex geometry. The mesh elements should maintain an appropriate aspect ratio, avoiding excessively elongated or distorted shapes, to ensure numerical accuracy and stability. Additionally, the mesh should be well-aligned with the boundaries and features of the model to minimize interpolation errors and enhance the precision of the analysis. It is always important to remember that the significance of the mesh is so crucial that even with a poorly constructed mesh, we can obtain results that are vastly different and full of errors.\n",

The method gained prominence in the 1960s and has since undergone significant advancements, driven by improvements in computer technology and numerical algorithms. Today, FEM is integral to fields such as aerospace, automotive, civil engineering, and biomedical engineering, offering highly accurate predictions and contributing to innovation and efficiency in product development. In this thesis however, our focus on FEM is specifically related to structural analysis and deformation problems. Since this thesis aims to explore the potential of using AI methods for solving FEM simulations, a brief introduction to neural networks and their functions is necessary.\n",

Introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958, Perceptron is a type of artificial neuron and one of the earliest models for supervised learning in neural networks. It simulates the way a single neuron in the human brain works by taking multiple input signals, assigning each a weight, summing them up, and then passing the result through an activation function to produce an output. This simple model can classify data into two categories by finding a linear decision boundary, making it foundational for understanding more complex neural network structures. Despite its limitations, such as being unable to solve problems that aren't linearly separable, the perceptron laid the groundwork for modern neural networks and deep learning.\n",

By moving in the opposite direction, gradient descent reduces the loss, thereby improving the performance of the neural network. However, the success of gradient descent in deep networks relies heavily on factors such as effective weight initialization, the choice of activation functions, and strategies to mitigate challenges like overfitting and the vanishing gradient problem. The introduction of ReLU activation functions, expressed as $Relu(x)=\\max(0,x)$, was instrumental in overcoming the vanishing gradient problem by ensuring that gradients remain significant in deeper layers, thus allowing for better learning and performance.\n",

Activation functions determine whether a neuron should be \"activated\" or \"fired\" based on its input, controlling the flow of information in the network. Without activation functions, the model would behave like a simple linear regression and would not be able to solve more complex tasks.\n",

For instance, in imbalanced datasets, where certain classes are underrepresented, a custom loss function might be designed to assign higher penalties to misclassifications of the minority class, thereby ensuring the model learns more effectively. Crafting a custom loss function often requires deep domain knowledge and experience, as it needs to balance the specific objectives of the task with the overall training process.
